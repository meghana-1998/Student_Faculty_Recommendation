Publications George Mason NLP George Mason University George Mason Natural Language Processing Group Natural language processing NLP aims to enable computers to use human languages so that people can for example interact with computers naturally or communicate with people who dont speak a common language or manipulate speech or text data at scales not otherwise possible The NLP group at George Mason Computer Science is interested in all aspects of NLP with a focus on building tools for under served languages We are currently working on multilingual models on building Machine Translation robust to L2 language variations and on NLP for documentation of endangered languages I have open PhD positions and am looking for several students to start in the Fall 2021 Do reach out if you have a passion for language and NLP Application Link https www2 gmu edu admissions aid apply now News August 2021 The GMNLP group is growing as Ziyu Yao will be joining CS GMU as an assistant professor May

has been supported by the following organizations companies All Multilingual NLP Machine Translation Morphology Robustness Language Documentation Speech Speech Most languages of the world are oral they are not traditionally written and even if an alphabet exists the community doesnt usually use it Hence building NLP systems that can directly operate on speech input is paramount Morphology Human language is marked by considerable diversity around the world and the surface form of languages varies substantially Morphology describes the way through which different word forms arise from lexemes Computational morphology attempts to reproduce this process across languages or uses machine learning models to model discover the morphophonological processes that exist in a language Robustness NLP systems are typically trained and evaluated in clean settings over data without significant noise However systems deployed in the real world need to deal with vast amounts of noise At GMU NLP we work towards making NLP systems more robust to several types of noise adversarial or naturally occuring Language Documentation Language Documentation aims at producing a permanent record that describes a language as used by its language community by producing a formal grammatical description along with a lexicon Our group works on integrating NLP systems into the documentation workflow aiming to speed up the process and help the work of field linguists and language communities Machine Translation Machine Translation is the task of translating between human languages using computers Starting from simple word for word rule based system in 1950s we now have large multilingual neural models that can learn translate between dozens of languages Multilingual NLP An exciting research direction that we pursue at GMU NLP is building multi lingual and polyglot systems The languages of the world often share similar characteristics and training systems cross lingually allows us to leverage these similarities and overcome data scarcity issues Recent Posts Browse all blog posts here Predicting Performance for Natural Language Processing Tasks This is a post regarding our paper that will be

sometimes be moved online and announced only in class Research Interests I am primarily interested in the problem of computing on encrypted data To maintain privacy and security it is increasingly important that our information remain encrpyted not just when at rest but at all times We have to balance this need with the desire that our data remain useful My research looks at how we can achieve

for download soon Secure multi party computation MPC allows multiple par ties to perform secure joint computations on their private inputs To day applications for MPC are growing with thousands of parties wish ing to build federated machine learning models or trusted setups forblockchains To address such scenarios we propose a novel MPC proto col that maximizes throughput when run with large numbers of parties In particular our protocol has both communication and computationcomplexity that decrease with the number of parties In particular weshow that when used as a triple generating service to produce offlinematerial for general MPC protocols our construction achieves a totalthroughput of 320 million triples per second when run with approxi mately 1 million parties Our protocol builds on prior protocols based onpacked secret sharing introducing new approaches to optimally leveragepacked sharing for general unpacked computation Secure parallel computation on national scale volumes of data Sahar Mazloom Phi Hung Le Samuel Ranellucci S Dov gordon Usenix Security 2020 Download We revisit the problem of performing secure computation of graph parallel algorithms focusing on the applications of securely outsourcing matrix factorization and histograms Leveraging recent results in low communication secure multiparty computation and a security relaxation that allows the computation servers to learn some differentially private leakage about user inputs we construct a new protocol that reduces overall runtime by 320X reduces the number of AES calls by 750X and reduces the total communication by 200X Our system can securely compute histograms over 300 million items in about 4 minutes and it can perform sparse matrix factorization which is commonly used in recommendation systems on 20 million records in about 6 minutes 1 Furthermore in contrast to prior work our system is secure against a malicious adversary that corrupts one of the computing servers Stormy Statistics in Tor by Measuring Securely Ryan Wails Aaron Johnson Daniel Starin Arkady Yerukhimovich S Dov Gordon ACM CCS 2019 Download Tor is a tool for Internet privacy with millions of daily users The Tor system benefits in many ways from information gathered about the operation of its network Measurements guide operators in diagnosing problems direct the efforts of developers educate users about the level of privacy they obtain and inform policymakers about Tor s impact However data collection and reporting can degrade user privacy contradicting Tor s goals Existing approaches to measuring Tor have limited capabilities and security weaknesses We present Stormy a general purpose privacy preserving measurement system that overcomes these limitations Stormy uses secure multiparty computation MPC to compute any function of the observations made by Tor relays while keeping those observations secret Stormy makes use of existing efficient MPC protocols that are secure in the malicious model and in addition it includes a novel input sharing protocol that is secure efficient and fault tolerant The protocol is non interactive which is consistent with how relays currently submit measurements and it allows the relays to go offline after input submission even while ensuring that an honest relay will not have its input excluded or modified The input sharing protocol is compatible with MPC protocols computing on authenticated values and may be of independent interest We show how Stormy can be deployed in two realistic models 1 run primarily by a small set of dedicated authorities or 2 run decentralized across the relays in the Tor network Stormy scales efficiently to Tor s thousands of relays tolerates network churn and provides security depending only on either Tor s existing trust assumption that at least one authority is honest in the first model or the existing assumption that a large fraction of relay bandwidth is honest in the second model We demonstrate how to use the system to compute two broadly applicable statistics the median of relay inputs and the cardinality of set union across relays We implement Stormy and experimentally evaluate system performance When Stormy is run among authorities we can perform 151 median computations or 533 set union cardinalities over 7 000 relay inputs in a single day When run among the relays themselves Stormy can perform 36 median computations or 134 set union cardinalities per day Thus both deployments enable non trivial analytics to be securely computed in the Tor network Two party Private Set Intersection with an Untrusted Third Party Phi Hung Le Samuel Ranellucci S Dov Gordon ACM CCS 2019 Download We construct new protocols for two parties to securely compute on the items in their intersection Our protocols make use of an untrusted third party that has no input The use of this party allows us to construct highly efficient protocols that are secure against a single malicious corruption Best of Both Worlds in Secure Computation with Low Communication Overhead Daniel Genkin S Dov Gordon Samuel Ranellucci ACNS 2018 Download When performing a secure multiparty computation with a few hundred parties using the best protocols known today bandwidth constraints are the primary bottleneck A long line of work demonstrates that n parties can compute a circuit C of depth d while communicating O C log C poly d n field elements per party as long as a majority of parties are honest However in the malicious majority setting a lot less is known The work of Nielsen and Ranellucci is the first to provide constant overhead in the communication complexity when a majority of parties are malicious their result demonstrates feasibility but is quite complex and impractical In this work we construct a new MPC protocol in the pre processing model We introduce a new middle ground our protocol has low communication and provides robustness when a majority of parties are honest and gives security with abort possibly with higher communication cost when a majority of players are malicious Robustness is impossible when a majority of parties are malicious viewing the increased communication complexity as a form of denial of service similar to an abort we view our result as providing the best of both worlds Secure Computation with Low Communication from Cross Checking S Dov Gordon Samuel Ranellucci Xiao Wang IACR Asiacrypt 2018 Download We construct new four party protocols for secure computation that are secure against a single malicious corruption Our protocols can perform computations over a binary ring and require sending just 1 5 ring elements per party per gate In the special case of Boolean circuits this amounts to sending 1 5 bits per party per gate One of our protocols is robust yet requires almost no additional communication Our key technique can be viewed as a variant of the dual execution approach but because we rely on four parties instead of two we can avoid any leakage achieving the standard notion of security Simple and Efficient Two Server ORAM S Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz Xiao Wang IACR Asiacrypt 2018 Download We show a protocol for two server oblivious RAM ORAM that is simpler and more efficient than the best prior work Our construction combines any tree based ORAM with an extension of a two server private information retrieval scheme by Boyle et al and is able to avoid recursion and thus use only one round of interaction In addition our scheme has a very cheap initialization phase making it well suited for RAM based secure computation Although our scheme requires the servers to perform a linear scan over the entire data the cryptographic computation involved consists only of block cipher evaluations A practical instantiation of our protocol has excellent concrete parameters for storing an N element array of arbitrary size data blocks with statistical security parameter λ the servers each store 4N encrypted blocks the client stores λ 2logN blocks and the total communication per logical access is roughly 10logN encrypted blocks Differentially Private Access Patterns in Secure Computation Sahar Mazloom and S Dov Gordon ACM CCS 2018 Download We explore a new security model for secure com putation on large datasets We assume that two servers have been employed to compute on private data that was collected from many users and in order to improve the efficiency of their computation we establish a new tradeoff with privacy Specifically instead of claiming that the servers learn nothing about the input values we claim that what they do learn from the computation preserves the differential privacy of the input Leveraging this relaxation of the security model allows us to build a protocol that leaks some information in the form of access patterns to memory while also providing a formal bound on what is learned from the leakage We then demonstrate that this leakage is useful in a broad class of computations We show that computations such as histograms PageRank and matrix factorization which can be performed in common graph parallel frameworks such as MapReduce or Pregel benefit from our relaxation We implement a protocol for securely executing graph parallel computations and evaluate the performance on the three examples just mentioned above We demonstrate marked improvement over prior implementations for these computations Secure Computation of MIPS Machine Code Xiao Wang S Dov Gordon Allen McIntosh and Jonathan Katz ESORICS 2016 Download Existing systems for secure computation require programmers to express the program to be securely computed as a circuit or in some domain specific language that can be compiled to a form suitable for applying known protocols We propose a new system that can securely execute native MIPS code with no special annotations Our system has the advantage of allowing programmers to use a language of their choice to express their programs together with any off the shelf compiler to MIPS it can be used for secure computation of existing legacy MIPS code as well Our system uses oblivious RAM for fetching instructions and performing load store operations in memory and garbled universal circuits for the execution of a MIPS ALU in each instruction step We also explore various optimizations based on an offline analysis of the MIPS code to be executed in order to minimize the overhead of executing each instruction while still maintaining security Leakage Resilient Public Key Encryption from Obfuscation Dana Dachman Soled S Dov Gordon Feng Hao Liu Adam O Neill and Hong Sheng Zhou PKC 2016 Download The literature on leakage resilient cryptography contains various leakage models that provide different levels of security In this work we consider the emph bounded leakage and the emph continual leakage models In the bounded leakage model Akavia et al TCC 2009 it is assumed that there is a fixed upper bound LL on the number of bits the attacker may leak on the secret key in the entire lifetime of the scheme Alternatively in the continual leakage model Brakerski et al FOCS 2010 Dodis et al FOCS 2010 the lifetime of a cryptographic scheme is divided into time periods between which the scheme s secret key is updated Furthermore in its attack the adversary is allowed to obtain some bounded amount of leakage on the current secret key during each time period In the continual leakage model a challenging problem has been to provide security against emph leakage on key updates that is leakage that is a function not only of the current secret key but also the emph randomness used to update it We propose a new modular approach to overcome this problem Namely we present a compiler that transforms any public key encryption or signature scheme that achieves a slight strengthening of continual leakage resilience which we call emph consecutive continual leakage resilience to one that is continual leakage resilient with leakage on key updates assuming emph indistinguishability obfuscation Barak et al CRYPTO 2001 Garg et al FOCS 2013 Under the stronger assumption of emph public coin differing inputs obfuscation Ishai et al TCC 2015 the leakage rate tolerated by our compiled scheme is essentially as good as that of the starting scheme Our compiler is obtained by making a new connection between the problems of leakage on key updates and so called sender deniable encryption Canetti et al CRYPTO 1997 which was recently realized for the first time by Sahai and Waters STOC 2014 In the bounded leakage model we develop a new approach to constructing leakage resilient encryption from obfuscation based upon the public key encryption scheme from iO iO and punctured pseudorandom functions due to Sahai and Waters STOC 2014 In particular we achieve leakage resilient public key encryption tolerating LL bits of leakage for any LL from iO iO and one way functions We build on this to achieve leakage resilient public key encryption with optimal leakage rate of 1 o 1 1 o 1 based on public coin differing inputs obfuscation and collision resistant hash functions Such a leakage rate is not known to be achievable in a generic way based on public key encryption alone We then develop entirely new techniques to construct a new public key encryption scheme that is secure under consecutive continual leakage resilience under appropriate assumptions which we believe is of independent interest Constant Round MPC with Fairness and Guarantee of Output Delivery S Dov Gordon Feng Hao Liu and Elaine Shi Crypto 2015 Download We study the round complexity of multiparty computation with fairness and guaranteed output delivery assuming existence of an honest majority We demonstrate a new lower bound and a matching upper bound Our lower bound rules out any two round fair protocols in the standalone model even when the parties are given access to a common reference string CRS The lower bound follows by a reduction to the impossibility result of virtual black box obfuscation of arbitrary circuits Then we demonstrate a three round protocol with guarantee of output delivery which in general is harder than achieving fairness since the latter allows the adversary to force a fair abort We develop a new construction of a threshold fully homomorphic encryption scheme with a new property that we call flexible ciphertexts Roughly our threshold encryption scheme allows parties to adapt flexible ciphertexts to the public keys of the non aborting parties which provides a way of handling aborts without adding any communication Multi Input Functional Encryption S Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz Feng Hao Liu Elaine Shi and Hong Sheng Zhou Eurocrypt 2014 Download Functional encryption FE is a powerful primitive enabling fine grained access to encrypted data In an FE scheme secret keys tokens correspond to functions a user in possession of a ciphertext ct Enc x and a token TKf for the function f can compute f x but learn nothing else about x An active area of research over the past few years has focused on the development of ever more expressive FE schemes In this work we introduce the notion of multi input functional encryption Here informally a user in possession of a token TKf for an n ary function f and multiple ciphertexts ct1 Enc x1 ct_n Enc x_n can compute f x1 xn but nothing else about the xi Besides introducing the notion we explore the feasibility of multi input FE in the public key and symmetric key settings with respect to both indistinguishability based and simulation based definitions of security Download the paper here Multi Client Verifiable Computation with Stronger Security Guarantees S Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz Feng Hao Liu Elaine Shi and Hong Sheng Zhou TCC 2015 Download At TCC 2013 Choi et al introduced the notion of multi client verifiable computation in which a set of clients outsource to an untrusted server the computation of a function f over their collective inputs in a sequence of time periods In that work the authors defined and realized multi client verifiable computation satisfying soundness against a malicious server and privacy against the semi honest corruption of a single client We explore the possibility of achieving stronger security guarantees in this setting in several respects We begin by introducing a simulation based notion of security in the universal com posability framework which provides a clean way of defining soundness and privacy in a single definition We show the notion is impossible to achieve even in the semi honest case if client server collusion is allowed Faced with this result we explore several meaningful relaxations and give constructions realizing them On the Relationship between Functional Encryption Obfuscation and Fully Homomorphic Encryption Joe l Alwen Manuel Barbosa Pooya Farshim Rosario Gennaro S Dov Gordon Stefano Tessaro and David A Wilson IMA Conference on Cryptography and Coding 2013 Download We investigate the relationship between Functional Encryption FE and Fully Homomorphic Encryption FHE demonstrating that under certain assumptions a Functional Encryption scheme supporting evaluation on two ci phertexts implies Fully Homomorphic Encryption We first introduce the notion of Randomized Functional Encryption RFE a generalization of Functional En cryption dealing with randomized functionalities of interest in its own right and show how to construct an RFE from a standard semantically secure FE For this we define the notion of entropically secure FE and use it as an intermediary step in the construction Finally we show that RFEs constructed in this way can be used to construct FHE schemes thereby establishing a relation between the FHE and FE primitives We conclude the paper by recasting the construction of RFE schemes in the context of obfuscation Multi party Computation of Polynomials and Branching Programs without Simultaneous Interaction S Dov Gordon Tal Malkin Mike Rosulek and Hoteck Wee Eurocrypt 2013 Halevi Lindell and Pinkas CRYPTO 2011 recently proposed a model for secure computation that captures communication patterns that arise in many practical settings such as secure computation on the web In their model each party interacts only once with a single centralized server Parties do not interact with each other in fact the parties need not even be online simultaneously In this work we present a suite of new simple and efficient protocols for secure computation in this one pass model We give protocols that obtain optimal privacy for the following general tasks Evaluating any multivariate polynomial F x_1 ldots x_n modulo a large RSA modulus N where the parties each hold an input x_i Evaluating any read once branching program over the parties inputs As a special case these function classes include all previous functions for which an optimally private one pass computation was known as well as many new functions including variance and other statistical functions string matching second price auctions classification algorithms and some classes of finite automata and decision trees Download the paper here Secure Two Party Computation in Sublinear Amortized Time Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz Vladimir Kolesnikov Fernando Krell Tal Malkin Mariana Raykova Yevgeniy Vahlis CCS 2012 Download Note that this proceedings version is considerably different from the ePrint version Traditional approaches to generic secure computation begin by representing the function f being computed as a circuit If f depends on each of its input bits this implies a protocol with complexity at least linear in the input size In fact linear running time is inherent for non trivial functions since each party must touch every bit of their input lest information about the other party s input be leaked This seems to rule out many applications of secure computation e g database search in scenarios where inputs are huge Adapting and extending an idea of Ostrovsky and Shoup we present an approach to secure two party computation that yields protocols running in sublinear time in an amortized sense for functions that can be computed in sublinear time on a random access machine RAM Moreover each party is required to maintain state that is only essentially linear in its own input size Our protocol applies generic secure two party computation on top of oblivious RAM ORAM We present an optimized version of our protocol using Yao s garbled circuit approach and a recent ORAM construction of Shi et al We describe an implementation of this protocol and evaluate its performance for the task of obliviously searching a database with over 1 million entries Because of the cost of our basic steps our solution is slower than Yao on small inputs However our implementation outperforms Yao already on DB sizes of 2 18 entries a quite small DB by today s standards A Group Signature Scheme From Lattice Assumptions Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz and Vinod Vaikuntanathan Asiacrypt 2010 Download Group signature schemes allow users to sign messages on behalf of a group while 1 main taining anonymity within that group with respect to an observer yet 2 ensuring traceability of a signer by the group manager when needed In this work we give the first construction of a group signature scheme based on lattices more precisely the learning with errors assump tion in the random oracle model Toward our goal we construct a new algorithm for sampling a random superlattice of a given modular lattice together with a short basis that may be of independent interest Partial Fairness in Secure Two Party Computation Dov Gordon and Jonathan Katz Eurocrypt 2010 Download A seminal result of Cleve STOC 86 is that in general emph complete fairness is impossible to achieve in two party computation In light of this various techniques for obtaining emph partial fairness have been suggested in the literature We propose a definition of partial fairness within the standard real ideal world paradigm that addresses deficiencies of prior definitions We also show broad feasibility results with respect to our definition partial fairness is possible for any randomized functionality f X times Y rightarrow Z_1 times Z_2 at least one of whose domains or ranges is polynomial in size Our protocols are always private and when one of the domains has polynomial size our protocols also simultaneously achieve the usual notion of security with abort In contrast to some prior work we rely on standard assumptions only We also show that as far as general feasibility is concerned our results are emph optimal with respect to our definition Specifically there exist functions with super polynomial domain and range for which it is impossible to achieve our definition On Complete Primitives for Fairness Dov Gordon Yuval Ishai Tal Moran Rafail Ostrovsky and Amit Sahai TCC 2010 For secure two party and multi party computation with abort classification of which primitives are em complete has been extensively studied in the literature However for emph fair secure computation where roughly speaking either all parties learn the output or none do the question of complete primitives has remained largely unstudied In this work we initiate a rigorous study of completeness for primitives that allow fair computation We show the following results textbf No short primitive is complete for fairness In surprising contrast to other notions of security for secure two party computation we show that for fair secure two party computation no primitive of size O log k is complete where k is a security parameter This is the case even if we can enforce parallelism in calls to the primitives i e the adversary does not get output from any primitive in a parallel call until it sends input to all of them This negative result holds regardless of any computational assumptions textbf Coin Flipping and Simultaneous Broadcast are not complete for fairness The above result rules out the completeness of two natural candidates coin flipping for any number of coins and simultaneous broadcast for messages of arbitrary length textbf Positive results To complement the negative results we exhibit a k bit primitive that emph is complete for two party fair secure computation This primitive implements a fair reconstruction procedure for a secret sharing scheme with some robustness properties We show how to generalize this result to the multi party setting textbf Fairness combiners We also introduce the question of constructing a protocol for fair secure computation from primitives that may be faulty We show a simple functionality that is complete for two party fair computation when the majority of its instances are honest On the flip side we show that this result is tight no functionality is complete for fairness if half or more of the instances can be malicious On the Round Complexity of Zero Knowledge Proofs Based on One Way Permutations Dov Gordon Hoeteck Wee David Xiao and Arkady Yerukhimovich Latincrypt 2010 We consider the following problem can we construct constant round zero knowledge proofs with negligible soundness for NP assuming only the existence of one way permutations We answer the question in the negative for fully black box constructions using only black box access to both the underlying primitive and the cheating verifier that satisfy a natural restriction on the adaptivity of the simulator s queries Specifically we show that only languages in coAM have constant round zero knowledge proofs of this kind Authenticated Broadcast with a Partially Compromised Public Key Infrastructure Dov Gordon Jonathan Katz Ranjit Kumaresan and Arkady Yerukhimovich Symposium on Stabilization Safety and Security of Distributed Systems 2010 Given a public key infrastructure PKI and digital signatures it is possible to construct broadcast protocols tolerating any number of corrupted parties Almost all existing protocols however do not distinguish between emph corrupted parties who do not follow the protocol and emph honest parties whose secret signing keys have been compromised but who continue to behave honestly We explore conditions under which it is possible to construct broadcast protocols that still provide the usual guarantees i e validity agreement to the latter Consider a network of n parties where an adversary has compromised the secret keys of up to t_c honest parties and in addition fully controls the behavior of up to t_a other parties We show that for any fixed t_c 0 and any fixed t_a there exists an efficient protocol for broadcast if and only if 2t_a min t_a t_c n When t_c 0 standard results imply feasibility We also show that if t_c t_a are not fixed but are only guaranteed to satisfy the bound above then broadcast is impossible to achieve except for a few specific values of n for these exceptional values of n we demonstrate a broadcast protocol Taken together our results give a complete characterization of this problem Invited for a special issue in Elsevier s Information and Computation journal Complete Fairness in Multi Party Computation without an Honest Majority Dov Gordon and Jonathan Katz Theory of Cryptography Conference 2009 Gordon et al recently showed that certain non trivial functions can be computed with complete fairness in the emph two party setting Motivated by their results we initiate a study of complete fairness in the emph multi party case and demonstrate the first completely fair protocols for non trivial functions in this setting We also provide evidence that achieving fairness is harder in the multi party setting at least with regard to round complexity Complete Fairness in Secure Two Party Computation Dov Gordon Carmit Hazay Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing STOC 2008 In the setting of secure two party computation two mutually distrusting parties wish to compute some function of their inputs while preserving to the extent possible various security properties such as privacy correctness and more One desirable property is emph fairness which guarantees that if either party receives its output then the other party does too Cleve STOC 1986 showed that complete fairness cannot be achieved emph in general in the two party setting specifically he showed essentially that it is impossible to compute Boolean XOR with complete fairness Since his work the accepted folklore has been that emph nothing non trivial can be computed with complete fairness and the question of complete fairness in secure two party computation has been treated as closed since the late 80s In this paper we demonstrate that this widely held folklore belief is emph false by showing completely fair secure protocols for various non trivial two party functions including Boolean AND OR as well as Yao s millionaires problem Surprisingly we show that it is even possible to construct completely fair protocols for certain functions containing an embedded XOR although in this case we also prove a lower bound showing that a super logarithmic number of rounds are necessary Our results demonstrate that the question of completely fair secure computation without an honest majority is far from closed Rational Secret Sharing Revisited Dov Gordon and Jonathan Katz Security and Cryptography for Networks 2006 We consider the problem of secret sharing among n rational players This problem was introduced by Halpern and Teague STOC 2004 who claim that a solution is emph impossible for n 2 but show a solution for the case n geq 3 Contrary to their claim we show a protocol for rational secret sharing among n 2 players our protocol extends to the case n geq 3 where it is simpler than the Halpern Teague solution and also offers a number of other advantages We also show how to avoid the continual involvement of the dealer in either our own protocol or that of Halpern and Teague Our techniques extend to the case of rational players trying to securely compute an arbitrary function under certain assumptions on the utilities of the players On Fairness in Secure Computation Dov Gordon PhD Dissertation 2010 Download Secure computation is a fundamental problem in modern cryptography in which mul tiple parties join to compute a function of their private inputs without revealing anything beyond the output of the function A series of very strong results in the 1980 s demonstrated that any polynomial time function can be computed while guaranteeing essentially every desired security property The only exception is the fairness property which states that no player should receive their output from the computation unless all players receive their out put While it was shown that fairness can be achieved whenever a majority of players are honest it was also shown that fairness is impossible to achieve in general when half or more of the players are dishonest Indeed it was proven that even boolean XOR cannot be computed fairly by two parties The fairness property is both natural and important and as such it was one of the first questions addressed in modern cryptography in the context of signature exchange One contribution of this thesis is to survey the many approaches that have been used to guaran tee different notions of partial fairness We then revisit the topic of fairness within a modern security framework for secure computation We demonstrate that despite the strong impos sibility result mentioned above certain interesting functions can be computed fairly even when half or more of the parties are malicious We also provide a new notion of partial fairness demonstrate feasibility of achieving this notion for a large class of functions and show impossibility for certain functions outside this class We consider fairness in the pres ence of rational adversaries and finally we further study the difficulty of achieving fairness by exploring how much external help is necessary for enabling fair secure computation Teaching MATH 199 Math Game Theory and the Theory of Games Last

code and design new ways to build software I work at the intersection of software engineering and human computer interaction I use behavioral methods to study developers as users of their programming tools understand what makes designing implementing and debugging software hard and re envision the relationship between developers and code A key focus of my work has been designing new techniques to view and manipulate code I have pioneered the design of crowdsourced programming environments which reify developer s design knowledge strategies and mental models in explicit forms which can be

Projects Programming Strategies Developers solve problems by applying programming strategies describing sequences of steps to debug reuse design test and understand code Experienced developers work better by using more effective strategies We ve been exploring ways to capture and make explicit the strategies developers use helping uncover how developers work differently and to create new ways to help developers benefit from the hard earned wisdom of experienced developers ICSE23 CHI22 VL HCC21 EMSE20 SIGCSE19 Debugging Mental Models As developers debug they use their mental models to formulate hypotheses about the cause of a defect Unfortunately when their hypotheses are wrong developers can waste time and get stuck gathering information that does not lead them any closer to the cause of the defect We ve conducted studies to understand how developers debug and the role of hypotheses in debugging and are exploring new forms of debugging tools which enable developers to find use and test relevant hypotheses from similar defects VL HCC22 PLATEAU21 VL HCC21 VL HCC20 Microtask Programming Onboarding on a new project is often a long hard process dissuading casual contributors from ever starting What if you could contribute code to a new software project in a few minutes How would enabling many transient contributors change software development We ve been exploring these questions through building web based programming environments which enable microtask programming and conducting studies to understand how they change software development work EMSE23a JSS21 FSE IP20 TSE18 SOFTWARE16 VL HCC15 ICSE15 UIST2014 CHASE13b Working with Design Decisions in Code Good documentation has long been argued to be the key to helping developers work more quickly and consistently with design decisions But our studies have found that documentation is left largely disconnected from code making it hard to write and update and causing it to become out of date and untrusted This leaves developers to instead reverse engineer design decisions from code causing rationale questions about design decisions to be some of the most challenging to answer We ve conducted studies to explore the nature of this problem and have invented new techniques to make documentation active and bidirectionally synchronized with code SOFTWARE23 EMSE23b PLATEAU21 FSE20 VL HCC19a VL HCC19b VL

EMSE15 PLATEAU11 CHASE10a Answering Reachability Questions What can make debugging in large and complex codebases so hard and time consuming We found that developers ask reachability questions searching across control flow for statements matching search criteria For example developers debugging a deadlock may reconstruct control flow describing where resources are acquired and released We designed Reacher which uses a static analysis to automate control flow searches enabling developers to query for statements on paths and interactively construct an interprocedural control flow

University Show Menu Hide Menu Home Research About Me Research Tools Publications Conferences Workshops Journals Magazines Talks RFCs CV NOTE I am actively looking for post docs graduate students and undergraduate students to work in the below research areas with me Research Foci My research focuses on measurable security in core Internet protocols Internet scale cybersecurity systems and application level endpoint protections that can be derived from these I am the director of the Measurable Security Lab MSL and this is the link to the lab s webpage Research in the MSL focuses on evaluating and evolving protections by using measurements and data analysis measurement based or measurable security This work involves systems implementation both of measurement apparatuses and endpoint security software large scale data analyses innovations to network protocols and ultimately developing Internet scale cybersecurity that works The MSL maintains the world s only complete longitudinal measurements of the Internet s first deployment of a secure core protocol the Domain Name System s DNS Security Extensions DNSSEC This is a 36 6 billion row database that spans 16 years and is actively growing and evolving We conduct research to learn lessons from what has worked in order to propose cybersecurity for tomorrow I have been conducting basic research while also being involved in industry policy settings for almost 20 years I believe basic research that comes from large scale measurements and data analyses synergizes well with operationalizing new solutions and conducting structured research investigations into real world cybersecurity and Internet security problems Areas and protocols that I work most directly with include the Domain Name System DNS with DNSSEC inter domain routing in the Border Gateway Protocol BGP Distributed Denial of Service DDoS attacks and Cybersecurity Threat Information CTI sharing STIX TAXII Communities of Trust etc My research is exploring settings like the 5G NextG Internet of Things IoT deployments mobile Healthcare mHealth and CyberPhysical Systems CPS If you are interested in exploring cybersecurity and or analyzing expansive operational data sets interested in inventing some of the world s next Internet scale security and privacy protections and are excited to do research that has a tangible impact on the world inquire about research opportunities About me I am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University with almost 20 years of work in the industry I studied physics and computer science at the Johns Hopkins University and earned my Ph D from the University of California Los Angeles Between these degrees I worked as a professional software engineer for many years building large scale production systems at a variety of companies After earning my doctorate I conducted research and led investigations as a principal scientist Verisign While there I studied and published works on inter domain routing security in the Internet researched designed implemented operationalized a large scale DDoS detection and defense system for DNS attacks and researched the previously unrecognized threats posed by name collisions with the DNS I am the former co Chair and vice Chair of ICANN s 2nd Security Stability and Resiliancy Review Team SSR2 RT which has now concluded our work Research Tools As part of my past present and future research I maintain a number of measurement sites and tools For example I have monitored analyzed and produced research findings about DNSSEC for over 16 years since shortly after it was standardized and maintain an archive of these measurements and results at SecSpider This is the longest running and still active monitoring and longitudinal tracking system of the global rollout of DNSSEC it is currently 16 years old Its longitudinal database has over 36 6 billion records in it which date back to the very beginning of the DNSSEC global rollout I am also the maintainer of libCanute which is a programmatic API for a reference implementation for the DANE protocol suite S MIME OPENPGP and a few other components from DANE my lab maintains a growing suite of open source software at GMU MSL We also operate DANEportal net and have implemented a proof of concept for securing end to end email called
